    Now, you can put is into vmware to see how it works.

Features:

    It contains the full toolchain that you can use directly without dealing with any tools needed.
        You can develop a new OS or do any other development work within this OS.

    GNU bash:  the bash version I use is an old one because I have found a bug in new versions that doesn't be fixed.
    GCC:       I add java frontend back to GCC and put it to /opt
    OpenSSL:   it contains OpenSSL that you can use directly without having to install it on Ubuntu.
    OpenSSH:   it contains OpenSSH that you can use directly without having to install it on Ubuntu.

Todo:

    Now, it only supports D version which stands for Developer Edition.
    I will produce C version which stands for Commercial Edition.
    I plan only to produce these TWO versions, no other versions will be produced.
    C version will add GUI, so it means D version does NOT have X.
